    <h1>Key Concepts of Observables</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Treat observable as continous stream of events which start&nbsp;(subscribe), lives&nbsp;(emit) and finally ends&nbsp;(complete)</li>
      <li>Observable instance might be treated as a single cell in spreadsheet</li>
      <li>With method pipe and operators one may combine observables creating new ones</li>
      <li>Like in spreadsheet when one changes a cell it may trigger another cells to recalculate</li>
    </ul>
